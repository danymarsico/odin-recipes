    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Spaghetti pasta</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Extra-Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>8 slices of bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 Onion,chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 large eggs,beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of Parmigiano cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of chopped parsley</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of Parmigiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>
        <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>

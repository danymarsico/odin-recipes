    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p1>Ricotta gnocchi are luxurious and flavorful, so simpler sauces are usually best here. A plain tomato sauce or an herby pesto are always great, but ricotta gnocchi can even shine when dressed simply in butter! </p1>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>12 Oz. Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 Oz. Parmigiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 Large egg</li>
        <li>1 Large egg yolk</li>
        <li>5 Oz. all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain ricotta by laying a few clean kitchen towels or a few layers of paper towels down on a sheet tray and spread the ricotta evenly across the entire surface using a rubber spatula to scrape everything out. Lay another towel or two on top and gently press to absorb the water. Let sit for about 5 minutes. Remove the top towel and scrape the ricotta into a large bowl; the ricotta should easily fall off the towel with little help. Meanwhile, set a large pot of heavily salted water on the stove to boil.</li>
        <li>Add the Parmesan, whole egg, egg yolk, and a pinch of salt into the bowl with the ricotta; mix well to combine. Fold the flour into the cheese mixture just until incorporated; loosely form into a ball.</li>
        <li>Turn out the ball onto a generously floured work surface (such as a clean counter or wooden cutting board) and divide the dough into four pieces, making sure to keep the exterior of the dough lightly floured.</li>
        <li>Working one piece at a time, roll each wedge into a long log, about the width of your thumb. Using a sharp knife or a bench scraper, cut the first log into little nuggets about the size of a large grape. Toss with flour and set aside. Repeat with the other three dough pieces.</li>
        <li>Gently add the dumplings to boiling water and boil for 3-5 minutes (start tasting after 3 minutes!).</li>
        <li>Toss the cooked gnocchi directly into sauce or cool on a sheet tray with a drizzle of olive oil until ready to use.</li>
    </ol>
